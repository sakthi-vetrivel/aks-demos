# aks-demos

Hey there!
This here's a repo of all our AKS demos for Ignite 2019!
Each demo has its own folder with a README that tells you how to set it up (or a context in the kubeconfig if you don't want to set it up), how to run it, and what to talk about while you're running the demo.

All demos have a corresponding recording that can be found in the AKS 2019 Ignite slide deck. 

Contributions are welcome :)
